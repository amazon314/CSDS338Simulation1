# CSDS338Simulation1
We have used python to write this project. After we finished part A and B we realized that to properly simulate these protocols we probably need to continuously insert new processes into the queue at a steady rate. In order to do so we would need to run 2 parallel functions that would need shared memory. Python doesn't have this functionality. Instead we could have used a language like c++ which gives more control over memory. To simulate a new process being added in protocol b we insert a new process with a higher priority than the process that is being run. When it starts to run the first process that has priority 1 a new process with priority zero is inserted. The task that is in progress is put back in the queue and the new process is run instead because it has higher priority.
